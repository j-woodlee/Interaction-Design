Keystone products have great usability

Jeff Han - multi-touch TED talk - 2006

measuring usability:
    1. Time to learn(learnability)
    2. Speed of Performance(efficiency)
    3. Rate of errors by users(errors)
    4. Retention over time(memorability)
    5. Subjective satisfaction(satisfaction)

error: user expectation is not the same as the result of their action(the UI misleads the user)
